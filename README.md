| Criterion                                       | Score | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Requirement coverage                         | 5     | Covers all key requirements: private, group, and public chats, message delivery/read tracking, attachments, and membership control with join/leave semantics. Clear alignment with functional brief. |
| 2. Modeling correctness & normalization         | 5     | Strong logical modeling — well-normalized entities, clear use of UUIDs, proper separation of message statuses, and attachment metadata. Relationships are sensible and scalable.                     |
| 3. Scalability & performance                    | 4     | Mentions indexing and sharding potential, UUIDs for horizontal scalability, and consideration for high-volume messaging. Could elaborate more on partitioning strategy or async write optimization.  |
| 4. Status & temporal events                     | 5     | Excellent handling — distinct tables for delivery and read history with timestamps. Supports multiple status transitions and reliable event tracking.                                                |
| 5. Security & multi-tenancy                     | 4     | Password storage and encryption noted; room to mention RLS or multi-tenant scoping for future readiness. Some architectural mentions of key management and E2EE are thoughtful.                      |
| 6. Files / multimedia handling                  | 4     | Separate table for file metadata and storage URL is good. Could improve by detailing versioning, content-type handling, or integration with CDN/object store.                                        |
| 7. Group membership semantics & history         | 5     | Implements `joined_at` and `left_at`, correctly addressing “no access to old messages.” Handles dynamic membership and potential removals well.                                                      |
| 8. Public channels semantics                    | 4     | `conversation_type` covers this, but schema-level enforcement for “read-all, post-members” could be stronger (e.g., via a visibility/access rule table).                                             |
| 9. Operational considerations / maintainability | 3     | Notes touch on caching, backups, and monitoring, but limited detail on migration strategy, schema evolution, or large-scale archiving.                                                               |
| 10. Clarity of notes & reasoning                | 5     | Notes and proposal are clear, structured, and professional. Well-balanced trade-off discussion of SQL vs NoSQL, hybrid design justification, and scalability reasoning.                              |


The submission demonstrates mature database design and system thinking, clearly above average. The model aligns tightly with the business requirements, and both the notes and proposal files show an understanding of real-world production constraints.

There are minor scalability and operational detail gaps, but overall, the work is strong, coherent, and well-argued.

Final:
Score: 44 / 50 (Strong Pass with 88%)
